# Description

## A mod that encourages dietary variety through diminishing returns.

Makes it so that eating the same thing over and over will give you fewer and fewer food benefits (health, stamina, eitr) restored each time.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`


---


## Configuration Details

1. **Lock Configuration**: Prevents changes to the mod's settings unless done by server admins.
2. **Diminishing Factor**: Sets the rate at which food benefits diminish with repeated consumption.
3. **Consumption Threshold**: Number of times a food can be eaten before its benefits start diminishing.
4. **History Length**: The number of unique food consumptions tracked for diminishing returns.
